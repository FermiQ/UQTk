Surrogate Construction Tutorials

Walks through methods of surrogate constrcution for Genz functions

================================================================================

surrogate_genz-BCS.ipynb:        Constructs a surrogate for a Genz function using BCS, calculating the NRMSE

surrogate_genz-Galerkin.ipynb:   Constructs a surrogate for a Genz function using Galerkin projection (with full and sparse quadrature), calculating the NRMSE

surrogate_genz-Regression.ipynb: Constructs a surrogate for a Genz function using regression, calculating the NRMSE

surrogate_genz.ipynb;            Constructs a surrogate for a Genz function using Galerkin Projection, regression, and BCS, calculating the NRMSE for each
