window example

contains a pair of Python scripts that propagate uncertainty in input parameters
through a heat transfer model using both a Monte Carlo sampling approach
and a non-intrusive spectral projection (NISP) via quadrature methods.

For more information, look in UQTk manual under

heat_transfer_window.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that produces a graph comparing PDF's
        of heat flux generated using NISP full and sparse quadrature methods
        and Monte Carlo sampling methods for three window models.
