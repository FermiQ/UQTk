==============================
dfi
==============================
use data-free inference to recover an approximate correlated posterior 
distribution for parameters of a line model
given summary statistics on marginals

To run this example, compile it via "make" in the line directory, then 
run it using: "./dfi_line.exe datainference"

Notes:
1) this example takes about 1 hour to run, and sends a lot of data to the screen. 
2) if your UQTk build links against external libraries (e.g. SUNDIALS), you will 
have to make sure that your Makefile
can find both those libraries and their include files. If the make fails, 
you may need to add the path to the cvode.h include
files using a -I path_to_include_folder and the path to the external library 
through a -L path_to_external_library statement.
